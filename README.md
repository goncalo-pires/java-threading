# Java Threading

## Introduction

The **Java Threading** repository is a personal project aimed at documenting my journey in learning **Java concurrency**, **multithreading**, and **performance optimization**. This repo serves as a collection of code snippets, examples, and projects that explore various aspects of Java's multithreading capabilities. The objective is to deepen my understanding of concurrent programming and to improve performance through effective use of Java threading mechanisms.

## Objectives

- To learn how to implement multithreading in Java using various classes and interfaces.
- To understand and apply concepts of thread safety, synchronization, and thread pools.
- To explore performance optimization in multithreaded Java applications.
- To apply knowledge through practical case studies and examples.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several folders based on the specific areas of learning. Below is an explanation of each section:

### 1. Threading Fundamentals

This section covers the basics of thread creation, execution, and debugging in Java. The key topics include:

- **Thread creation with `Runnable` Interface**:
- **Thread class capabilities**
- **Thread creation with `java.lang.Thread`**
- **Case Study: Interactive Multithreading Application**
